        <p>In the TATA 340 PP 40 project, we designed an advanced energy storage system, charging up to 340V and capable
            of delivering 40kJ of energy. The system features ultra capacitors (UCaps) with real-time voltage and
            current monitoring using Electrohms VH1K0T01 voltage sensors and HE100T01 Hall Effect-based current sensors.
            The CAN protocol was used to transmit key data, enabling external systems to monitor and interact with the
            storage system in real time.</p>
