        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The NPOL FOXBMS Project is a research and development initiative focusing on Battery Management Systems
            (BMS)
            for efficient and safe energy storage solutions. This project leverages the FOXBMS (Flexible Open-source
            Battery Management System) platform,
            designed to support advanced monitoring, control, and safety features for high-performance battery packs.

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>The NPOL FOXBMS Project is based on an open-source, modular architecture that integrates both hardware and
            software components for efficient BMS operation.</p>
        <h3>Hardware Overview</h3>
        <p>The hardware design includes a central processing unit, voltage and temperature sensors, and interfaces for
            external communication.</p>
        <h3>Software Overview</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data acquisition from cell voltage and temperature sensors</li>
            <li>Data processing and real-time monitoring</li>
            <li>Battery diagnostics, balancing, and protection</li>
            <li>Communication protocol (e.g., CAN or UART) integration</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>
// Example of data acquisition code snippet
int readVoltage(int cell) {
    // Code to read voltage from a specific cell
    return cell_voltage[cell];
}
        </code></pre>
