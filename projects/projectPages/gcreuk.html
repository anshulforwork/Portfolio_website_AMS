        <p>
            This project aimed to supply GCRE UK with a reliable, high-performance energy storage system powered by Skeleton UCAP modules. We configured these modules using the CAN protocol and built a data decoder with Arduino to monitor and analyze CAN data in real time. This solution provides scalable energy storage, efficient configuration, and precise data interpretation.
